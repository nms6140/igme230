                <h1>EAS Design</h1>
                <p>In this particular project the point was to design an Emergency Alert System that was easy to navigate and hard to send accidental alerts. My design was focused around a computer dashboard with simple tabs for everything. Each type of action had a confirmation process as well that had different lengths depending on the influences the alerts could have. <br>I learned how to design with my user in mind and not just myself. Although the design is fairly attentaive to style and color, it is simple and easy to navigate.</p>
