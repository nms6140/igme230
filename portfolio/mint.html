                <h1>Mint App Redesign</h1>
                <p>In this particular project the point was to come up with three very different designs for the same app. We were told to use an already existing app so as to only focus on the visuals of styling and not on creation. <br> I chose the Mint app which helps with finances and budgeting. The 3 designs I created (as seen above) were based off of 3 very different feelings. One is a classy, sleek, elegant style with dark blues and accents of orange. Another is light and bright with pastels and rounded edges. And the last is simple and straightforward with blue accents and a professional look and feel. This whole project took close to 3 weeks to complete and I learned the skills of making your style a story instead of just colors and shapes on a screen.</p>
