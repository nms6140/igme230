        <div class="overview">
            <p>The point of this project was to focus on the interaction design of a news site. We were taught to focus on what takes you where and how it goes about doing so. I chose to redesign the reporter website into something more referencing fashion website design. <br>
                <br>
                Fashion web design has lots of geometric shapes, experimental design, and tunnel-vision focus. The sites are built to come off as sharp and interesting and many use minimal color, choosing to add color to the elements they really want to stand out. I took all these elements and used them in a way that made sense for -and aided to- the interactivity of a news site.</p>
