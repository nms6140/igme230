        <div class="overview">
            <p>The point of this project was to do 3 different styles or the same app. The point was to learn how different simply changing the visuals can make the look and feel of an app. <br>
                <br>
               I chose to redesign an app called Mint that helps with budgeting, taxes, earnings, etc. Many different people have to rely on help for keeping all their money things straight, so I based my designs off of different types of people. The three styles I eventually went with after quite a bit of research were Sunsets and Soft glows, Graphic Linear Nights (as seen on the moodboard adjacent), and Buisness Casual (as seen on the moodboard below).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="learned">
            <p> I really went with each style and even changed visual like how the graphs may look different and focus on different things depending on the group. <br>
                <br>
                With this project, I worked in illustrator and learned how to not stick to one style. The trick to not being biased to a style when coming up with possible routes to take, is to take the same amount of time on all of them. The more time taken on a style, the more you want it to succeed. Also there's sometimes multiple "right" answers to the same problem. </p>
