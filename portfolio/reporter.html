        <div class="overview">
            <p>The point of this project was to focus on the interaction design of a news site. We were taught to focus on what takes you where and how it goes about doing so. I chose to redesign the reporter website into something more referencing fashion website design. <br>
                <br>
                Fashion web design has lots of geometric shapes, experimental design, and tunnel-vision focus. The sites are built to come off as sharp and interesting and many use minimal color, choosing to add color to the elements they really want to stand out. I took all these elements and used them in a way that made sense for -and aided to- the interactivity of a news site.</p>

        <div class="learned">
            <p> In this project I used applications I hadn't worked in yet like After Effects, as well as tools that I'm very familiar with like Adobe Illustrator. I learned how to pair programs together and design across more than one platform, as well as the challenges behind having the programs use different controls. <br>
                <br>
                With this project, I learned how to take one specific style of reference and apply it to something that wasn't the same genre as the reference. I gathered all fashion website references, but having the Reporter website look completely like a fashion website was not my goal, so I had to learn how to execute what I saw into what I needed to make this project work.</p>
