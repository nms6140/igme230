        <div class="overview">
            <p>The point of this project was to create an interactive "dream sequence" or abstract piece that means something to the creator. I made this small, simple interactive piece to capture the difference between how put together people seem versus how they actual are. The interactive parts of this piece are simple. They both revolve around clicking, but have no prompting. This makes it so the user has to stumble around in confusion trying to find the interactivity and clikcing randomly on everything. <br>
                <br>
               The first an more obvious interactive part is the houses. When the inner part of the house is clicked, the house reacts by slowly exploding. Yet, when the house exists the screen, it comes back composed. I used this to symbolize that sometimes people breaking is just a small part before they piece themselves back together. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="learned">
            <p>The second part of this interactive piece is the much less obvious one. The sun, if clicked on starts to change color. That on its own is pretty easy to stumble upon. But the metaphor actually comes from
                the color slowly changing to pure red the more it's clicked until finally it sets off "panic mode" where everything stops moving and being interactive and forces the user to "reboot" before the application becomes interactive again. This was my way of showing some things happen over time until the persistency gets to be too much and even the strongest people find themselves shutting down.<br>
                <br>
                With this project, I learned a lot about arrays and changes over time in javascript. The piece was really fun to work with and I wish I spent more time with it and build it out more. There's a lot I would change now with the knowledge I have of p5.</p>
